# 1:1 with Alex Chen - 2026-02-20

## Topics
1. Q1 goals check-in
2. Promotion timeline
3. Feedback on stakeholder communication

## Notes
- Alex confirmed chargeback model is the P0 for Q1. Stay focused.
- Promotion conversation likely in H2. Key gap: stakeholder-facing communication. Need more reps presenting to leadership.
- Alex suggested I present the v2 results at the April Risk Review instead of him.

## Action Items
- [ ] Jane: volunteer to present at April Risk Review
- [ ] Jane: draft a one-pager on v2 approach for non-technical stakeholders
