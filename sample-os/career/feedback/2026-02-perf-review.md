# Performance Review - 2026 H1 Mid-Cycle

## Manager Feedback (Alex Chen)
Jane has been strong on execution this half. The chargeback model v1 shipped on time and the baseline metrics were well-received by leadership. Area for growth: communicating findings to non-technical stakeholders earlier in the process, not just at QBR.

## Peer Feedback
- Mike (mwong): "Jane is very thorough with her analysis. She caught a labeling issue I missed. Would be great to see her present more in team meetings."
- Priya (pkumar): "Reliable partner on cross-functional requests. Always responds quickly with accurate data."
